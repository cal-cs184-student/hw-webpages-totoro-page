		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p><i>Give a high-level overview of what you implemented in this homework. Think about what you've built as a whole. Share your thoughts on what interesting things you've learned from completing the homework.</i></p>

		<p>In this homework, we implemented basic rasterization pipelines as well as antialiasing techniques. We also implemented texture mapping with pixel sampling and level sampling, and explored transforms as well as barycentric coordinates. 
		</p>

		<h2>Task 1: Drawing Single-Color Triangles</h2>
		
		<p><i>Walk through how you rasterize triangles in your own words:</i> 
			<p>Basic rasterization for a triangle at a sample rate of 1 involves figuring out what color to fill each pixel in the image. You can rasterize triangles through the three line point test, which checks to see whether a pixel falls within the bounds of the given triangle. First, we check the winding order of the given triangle by examining the cross product of two consecutive edges. If the cross product is negative, that indicates a clockwise winding order and we swap two consecutive edges to turn the winding order into counter-clockwise. If the cross product is positive, then the winding order is already counter clockwise and we don't need to change the ordering.</p> 
			<p>Next, we calculate the equation \(â€“(x - X_i)\delta Y_i + (y - Y_i)\delta X_i \) for each edge of the triangle where \(\delta Y_i\) is the difference between the y-coordinates of two consecutive vertices and \(\delta X_i\) is the difference between the x-coordinates of two consecutive vertices. For each pixel, we plug it into each of these three equations, and if it's \(>=0\) for all three lines, we consider it to be inside the area of the triangle and fill the pixel with the given color. If it's not inside the area of the triangle, we don't fill it. </p>
		</p>
		<p><i>Explain how your algorithm is no worse than one that checks each sample within the bounding box of the triangle:</i> 
			It's no worse than one that checks each sample becuase we only iterate over each pixel within the bounding box of the triangle instead of the entire pixel space of the image.

		<h2>Task 2: Antialiasing by Supersampling</h2>
		<p><b><i>Supersampling Algorithm and Data Structures Walkthrough:</i></b></p>
			<p>To implement supersampling, we first initialized the sample buffer to be of size \(width * height * sample\_rate\) in order to store the subpixel information we gained from sampling at a higher frequency. After initializing the sample buffer, we modified <code>rasterize_triangle()</code> to add support for super sampling by adding an inner nested for loop that loops over each pixel \(NxN\) times, where N is \(\sqrt(sample\_rate)\). To calculate the center of the subpixel, we used the formula \[pixel\_x + (sample\_index\_x + 0.5) * (1/(\sqrt(sample\_rate)))\] where \(pixel\_x\) is the x-coordinate of the pixel, \(sample\_index\_x\) is the x-coordinate of the subpixel, and \(\sqrt(sample\_rate)\) is the square root of the sample rate. We did the same for the y-coordinate.

			After calculating the center of the subpixel, we then checked if the subpixel was inside the triangle by with the three line point test as implemented in task 1. If the subpixel was inside the triangle, we set the sample buffer at index \[(pixel\_y*width + pixel\_x) * sample\_rate + (sample\_index\_y* \sqrt(sample\_rate) + sample\_index\_x)\] to the color of the triangle. Once we've properly filled the sample buffer, we then resolve the sample buffer to the frame buffer by averaging out each subpixel within each respective pixel to determine the averaged RGB value for the pixel, and save that averaged color to the framebuffer. 
			</p>

		<p><i>Why is supersampling useful? What modifications did you make to the rasterization pipeline in the process? Explain how you used supersampling to antialias your triangles.</i></p>
			<p>Supersampling is the method involving first sampling at a higher frequency where each pixel has \(NxN\) samples then downsampling by averaging the subpixel values, and it's useful because it's an antialiasing technique which can reduce jaggies and other artifacts to significantly improve the image quality. We had to make modifications to the rasterization pipeline by introducing a sample buffer of size width by height by sample rate and introducing another inner nested for loop to <code>rasterize_triangle()</code> which loops over each pixel \(NxN)\ times. We also had to modify how the sample buffer resolved to the frame buffer by making sure we had to average out the subpixels within each pixel. Supersampling antialiased our triangles by smoothing out the jagged edges with averaged pixel color values, rather than harsh jaggies. </p>

		<p>As the sampling rate increases, the jaggies become smoother and smoother and the overall quality of the image sharpens. This is because as we increase the supersampling rate, we're taking more samples per pixel and storing these into our sample buffer, giving us much more fine-grained detail that we can average out for the final pixel value. This is especially helpful for jaggies at sharp triangle vertices, where the triangle might be broken at low sampling rates, but we can see it becomes much more blurred and smooth and connected as the sampling rate incrased to 9 and 16 in the above screenshots.</p>

		<h2>Task 4: Barycentric coordinates</h2>
		<p><i>Explain barycentric coordinates with an image to aid in the explanation</i></p>
		<p>Barycentric coordinates allow us to linearly interpolate values at vertices by representing the sample point as a weighted combination of the three triangle vertices instead of in regular Cartesian coordinates. This interpolation creates a smoothly varying surface inside the triangle, which is useful for when we want a continuous spectrum. In this triangle with one yellow vertex, one black vertex, and one reduce vertex, we're able to produce a smoothly blended color triangle gradient through barycentric coordinates. </p>

		<h2>Task 5: "Pixel sampling" for texture mapping</h2>
		<p><i>Explain pixel sampling and how we implemented it to perform texture mapping. Discuss 2 different pixel sampling methods (nearest and bilinear)</i></p>
		<p>Pixel sampling is the method of mapping a texture onto a triangle by sampling the color of the texel (u,v) that is nearest to the barycentric coordinates of the pixel. This method is straightforward, but can create alisasing artifacts. We examined two different pixel sampling methods: nearest and bilinear. Nearest sampling (also known as nearest neighbor sampling) takes the color of the texel that is closest to the barycentric coordinates of the pixel. On the other hand, bilinear sampling takes a weighted average of the four nearest texels surrounding the barycentric coordinates through 3 LERPs (linear interpolations). Bilinear sampling tends to have a blurred effect as compared to nearest sampling. After determining the texel value, we use the texel value to fill in the pixel value. </p>

		<p>Even at a sample rate of 1, switching from nearest to bilinear sampling reduces the Moire effects on the swirled logo by softening edges. While bilinear filtering doesn't fully replace supersampling, it still provides a noticeable improvement in rasterization quality at low sample rates. In this image of the swirled logo, the bilinear sampling at sample rate 1 produces a visually similar effect to nearest sampling at a sample rate of 16, displaying how texture filtering can act as a form of antialiasing.</p>


		<h2>Task 6: "Level Sampling" with mipmaps for texture mapping</h2>
		<p><i>Explain level sampling and how we implemented it for texture mapping</i></p>
		<p>Level sampling revolves around the idea of selecting the appropriate mipmap level when performing texture mapping, where mipmap levels refer to a sequence of precomputed downsampled versions of a texture. Each consecutive mipmap level is half the resolution of the previous level. Level sampling takes advantage of differentials to calculate the rate of change of texture coordinates (u,v) across screen space, since the texture coordinates may change at different rates depending on perspective and distance from the viewer.</p>
			
		<p>Higher differentials indicate that the texture is changing a lot and being "stretched" over a specific area, and therefore needs a higher resolution texture in order to reduce antialiasing effects and preserve detail. On the other hand, smaller differentials indicate that the texture is not being changed a lot and therefore does not need a higher resolution texture since the texture is being so compressed when it's viewed from a farther distance. By determining the proper level, we can determine what mipmap level to use at different locations. </p>

		<p>To implement level sampling, we first computed the texture differentials (du/dx, dv/dx, du/dy, dv/dy) from neighboring texture samples. ADD MORE DETAIL HERE</p>
