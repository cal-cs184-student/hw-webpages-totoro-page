		<h2>Part 2: Simulation via numerical integration</h2>
		<i>Experiment with some the parameters in the simulation. To do so, pause the simulation at the start with P, modify the values of interest, and then resume by pressing P again. You can also restart the simulation at any time from the clothâ€™s starting position by pressing R.</i>

		<br><br>

		<i>Describe the effects of:</i>
		<li><i>Changing the spring constant <code>ks</code>; how does the cloth behave from start to rest with a very low <code>ks</code>? A high <code>ks</code>?</i> When there's a very low <code>ks=500</code>, the cloth seems a lot more soft and flexible with a deeper drape and it has more motion as it's falling as well. When there's a very high <code>ks=50000</code>, the cloth seems extremely stiff and barely creases in on itself and has a very small drape as well. It just seems to be made of a much thicker material that doesn't fold as easily.  </li>

		<h2>Part 3: Handling collisions with other objects</h2>
		<i>Describe your implementation of handling collisions with spheres and planes.</i>
		<br><br>
		For handling collisions with spheres, we code up the <code>Sphere:Collide</code> function to first calculate the distance between the given <code>PointMass</code> position and the sphere's center by subtracting the sphere's center from the <code>PointMass</code> position and taking the norm as the distance. If the computed distance is less than the sphere's radius, this indicates that the <code>PointMass</code> lies inside the sphere's radius. Since we only care about the <code>PointMass</code> that lie inside the sphere's radius, we then compute the tangent point on the surface of the sphere by adding the unit direction between the sphere and the <code>PointMass</code> scaled by the size of the radius.  Once we have this tangent point, we calculate the correction vector as the difference between this tangent point and the last position of the <code>PointMass</code>. We then apply this correction vector to the <code>PointMass</code> position by setting the position to be the last position plus the correction vector multiplied by <code>(1-friction)</code> to account for the friction of the collision, essentially bumping up the position of the <code>PointMass</code> up to the surface of the sphere. 

		<br><br>

		For handling collisions with planes, we code up the <code>Plane:Collide</code> function to check if the <code>PointMass</code> is below the plane's height by taking the difference between the <code>PointMass</code>'s position and the plane's given point, and checking if the dot product of this difference with the plane's normal is less than the <code>SURFACE_OFFSET</code>. If it's less than the offset, this indicates that the <code>PointMass</code> is below the plane's height and we need to adjust it. To do this correction, we compute the tangent point on the plane by subtracting the normal direction of the plane, scaled by the distance to the plane adjusted by the offset, from the <code>PointMass</code>'s position. Similar to the sphere collision, we calculate the correction vector as the difference between the tangent point and the <code>PointMass</code>'s last position. We then apply this correction vector to the <code>PointMass</code> position by setting the position to be the last position plus the correction vector multiplied by <code>(1-friction)</code> to account for friction of the collision.
		<br><br>
		
		In addition, we also modify the <code>Cloth::Collide</code> code to iterate through all the <code>PointMass</code> object, and in each iteration, we iterate through every <code>CollisionObject</code> and check for collisions with the <code>PointMass</code> object.

		<i>Show us screenshots of your shaded cloth from scene/sphere.json in its final resting state on the sphere using the default ks = 5000 as well as with ks = 500 and ks = 50000. Describe the differences in the results.</i>

		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">
				<tr>
					<td>
						<img src="sphere_500.png" width=90% alt="Sphere ks 500"/>
						<figcaption>ks = 500</figcaption>
					</td>
					<td>
						<img src="sphere_5000.png" width=90% alt="Sphere ks 5000"/>
						<figcaption>ks = 5000</figcaption>

						<figcaption>ks = 50000</figcaption>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		</div>

		<br>
		As the ks increases, the cloth seems to be much more stiff and rigid and less likely to drape softly over the sphere. The cloth with <code>ks = 500</code> is much more flexible and drapes over the sphere more naturally and molds over the sphere, while the cloth with <code>ks = 50000</code> is very stiff and doesn't mold to the sphere's shape as much and appears to extrude out more. 

		<br><br>

		<i>Show us a screenshot of your shaded cloth lying peacefully at rest on the plane.</i>

		<h2>Part 4: Handling self-collisions</h2>
		<i>Describe your implementation of handling self-collisions.</i>
		<br><br>
		To handle self-collision, we first write a helper function <code>Cloth::hash_position</code> which hashes a given 3D position into a unique float based on membership in a grid. ADD MORE HERE

		<br><br>

		Next, we wrote a function to actually build a spatial map out of all the point masses by iterating through each point mass, computing the hash based on the point mass position, checking if the hash is already in the spatial map, and if not, adding it to the spatial map.
		<br><br>

		Then, we wrote the <code>Cloth::self_collide</code> function to iterate through all the point masses and check for collisions with other point masses in the same spatial map cell. We first calculate the hash of that position and check if there are any other point masses in the same cell. ADD MORE HERE

		<br><br>
		Lastly, we modified the <code>PointMass::Collide</code> function to check for self-collisions by building the spatial map, and then iterating through the all of the point masses and calling <code>self_collide</code> to check for self collision. 

		<br><br>
		<i>Show us at least 3 screenshots that document how your cloth falls and folds on itself, starting with an early, initial self-collision and ending with the cloth at a more restful state (even if it is still slightly bouncy on the ground).</i>
